# A-Trading-Strategy-of-Taiwan-s-Stock-Index-by-Random-Forest-

My  paper  attempts  to  maintain  the  originality  and  breadth  of  data.  I  have incorporated as much as possible of all market data (on a daily basis) related to the Taiwan  Capitalization  Weighted  Stock  Index  (TWII),  and  have  combined  the macroeconomic data of Taiwan and U.S. (on a monthly basis). Then I use these data to build the Random Forest model to forecast the daily direction of TWII. There are 11 categories  of  the  data  used  in  this  paper.  After  data  conversion  and  parameter optimization, a total of 711 variables were obtained. All 19 Random Forest models were trained and forecast the daily direction of TWII by means of Walk-Forward Analysis (WFA), respectively. Then I use Stacking method to build another new Random Forest model, which uses all these prediction results to train. Then I will get the final prediction results of the direction of TWII. At the end, a simple investment strategy is designed by 
the final prediction results for investing in Taiwan Stock Price Index Futures. Then I can know the feasibility of investment by the model prediction results. The strategy profit factor was found to be 2.3, with an Annualized Rate of Return of 37.5% and a winning percentage of 65%.
